Reproducible Data Peer Assignment 1
=======================================================

This is my first R markdown file.

Here, I am going to load the activity.csv file into R.

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("./Data/activity.csv")
summary (activity)
str(activity)
```

I am now going to remove the NA values using the complete function and store it into the a new data frame.

```{r}
activityComplete <- activity[complete.cases(activity),]
summary (activityComplete)
str(activityComplete)
```
