Reproducible Data Peer Assignment 1
=======================================================

This is my first R markdown file.

Load the activity.csv file into R.

```{r}
activity <- read.csv("./Data/activity.csv")
summary (activity)
str(activity)
```

Remove the NA values using the complete function and store it into the a new data frame.

```{r}
activityComplete <- activity[complete.cases(activity),]
summary (activityComplete)
str(activityComplete)
```

Create a dataframe with aggregated steps taken each day.

``` {r}
stepsByDate <-aggregate(activityComplete$steps, by=list(Category=activityComplete$date),FUN=sum)
names(stepsByDate) <- c("date", "steps")
summary(stepsByDate)
str(stepsByDate)
```

Create histogram of steps taken each day.
```{r}
hist(stepsByDate$steps)
```

Calculate mean and media total number of steps taken per day.
```{r}
mean(stepsByDate$steps)
median(stepsByDate$steps)
```
